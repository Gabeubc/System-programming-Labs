# System-programming-Labs
The course have two parts:

## OS internal part:
for the OS internal part we use the OS161 operating system for our laboratories:

### Lab_01: Explore OS161 

In this lab we install the <a href="https://github.com/marcopalena/polito-os161-docker" target="_blank">OS161</a> operating system and explore it.

## Programming part:

For the programming part we will use RUST as programming language.

### Lab_01: 

At the end of the exercise, if properly carried out, students will be able to
- Use the cargo programme, correctly handling the reference to external libraries 
and the compilation process, and know the structure of a Rust programme
- Correctly use flow control constructs and the match instruction
- Understand the concept of owning a value and distinguish, in each segment of 
code segment, variables that have a value from those that don't
Manipulate strings, perform conversions between strings and byte arrays; know the 
difference between byte and char in string and slice handling
Understand the semantics of passing parameters to functions
- Perform function testing, referring to pre-existing tests and knowing how to 
write unit tests
- Handling arguments passed through the command line
